        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon warm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 apples - peeled, cored and chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup raisins</li>
        <li>¼ cup confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Step by Step Directions</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
     <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 10-inch tube pan. Cover raisins with warm water and let soak for 10 minutes; drain. Whisk flour, spices, and salt together in a bowl; set aside.</p>
     <h4>Step 2</h4>
     <p>Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl until fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla. Stir baking soda and 1 tablespoon warm water together until smooth; stir into sugar mixture. Mix in flour mixture, apples, and strained raisins until well blended. Pour batter into prepared pan.</p>
     <h4>Step 3</h4>
     <p>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool cake in pan. Once cool, shake pan to loosen cake. Turn onto plate, and dust with confectioners' sugar.</p>
